            <h3>II. Design Evolution</h3>
            <p>Based on the feedback we gather from low-fidelity prototype reflection, classmates’ suggestions, and Juliette. We figured out the following four areas to improve in our computer prototype and we implemented them.
              <br>
              <br>
              1. The first thing that improved was the sounds on our website. Due to the low-fidelity prototype reflection, one of the peers pointed out that <b>the sounds are annoying</b> which could decrease the <b>usability</b>. People will not have our product if it provides bad experiences. Now after the improvement, <b>the sounds in our computer prototype can easily guide users to find the buttons</b>.
              <br><br>
              2. The second thing that improved was the guide of how the sound “moves”. Due to classmates’ suggestions, one of the peers pointed out that it costs a lot of time to understand <b>why we move the speaker in a reverse position of the cursor</b> and she hopes to see a clear user guide when she uses our website to increase the <b>usability</b>. This suggestion helps us and now we have improved our system by providing a detailed user guide by step-to-step instruction and a detailed explanation of the concepts of moving. Please review our <b>User manual and installation guide</b> for a detailed explanation.
              <br>
              <br>
              3. The third thing that improved was the indication of whether the user clicked the button or not. Due to the feedback that we got from Juliette, she pointed out that she cannot figure out if she clicked the button or not with her eyes closed. She suggested that we should <b>have an indication of whether the user clicked the button or not</b> to increase <b>usability and user experiences</b>. Now <b>there is a sound that indicates it</b>.
              <br>
              <br>
              4. The last thing that improved was that we used straight-forward instead of newspaper model. In our low-fidelity prototype, we tested straight-forward, newspaper, and Semi-cylinder models. Then we got the result that the newspaper could be the best solution. However, when we started the computer prototype, we found that it is <b>not feasible</b> to build our website in the newspaper way since it will be <b>hard for the user to find whether the sound is lower or upper</b> and is <b>hard to implement</b>. So we built our website with <b>the straight-forward model</b>, the sounds are <b>moving in front and behind instead of up and down</b>. <b>Now it is feasible</b> to test all functions.
              </p>

            <div class=User_center>
              <p>To access our prototype, open your browser and navigate to the following link: </p><a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~lduan5/hci/notebook/comp_proto/welcome.html">Computer Prototype</a><p>We have a detailed tutorial before the demo please read instructions carefully</p>
            </div>

            <hr>
            <br>
            <h3>IV. User population</h3>
            <p>In our project proposal, our target population is <b>those who have been non-sighted from birth</b>; specifically, those who (1) <b>have no visual preconceptions about what the internet looks like or what a website looks like</b> , and (2) are <b>accustomed to physically navigating their world through aural cues</b>. we suspect this population has a superior capacity to build an internal model of an environment based on its reverberant characteristics. We know it might be hard to find our wanted target population to do the test. So if you are not visually impaired and cannot find any visually impaired users. We then wish to <b>cover the user’s eyes when they do the test with something like blindfolds</b>. This could be <b>a desired alternative</b> for our test.

            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3>V. Usability goals</h3>
            <p><b>1. Learnability:</b> The user should be able to learn the sound mapping quickly.<br>
              We want our users to quickly understand how moving the cursor affects the sounds they hear. Less than 2 minutes on the first page, the user should have found the button and clicked on it.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>2. Ease of use:</b> The user should be able to identify the position of multiple objects on the screen and determine how they are placed in reference to one another.<br>
              The system should allow users to feel that the objects have their own space and that the cursor helps them move towards the object. The user should not have to be reminded of how to navigate the system more than twice. The user should be able to perform every task without accessing the User Manual more than twice.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>3. Efficiency:</b> The system should not be stressful or cause any sort of sound anxiety to the user. Instead, it should feel helpful and inviting.<br>
              The system should feel inviting, comfortable and help the users orient themselves by sound cues. After three minutes of use, the user should not demonstrate any visible signs of frustration, stress, anxiety, or confusion. Visible signs to be considered are: facial expressions, physical movements (hands and legs moving uncomfortably, tense), comments, or extensive mouse movements.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>4. Effectiveness:</b> The system should permit the user to find objects without thinking too much.<br>
              Users should be able to navigate into pages and directly follow the sound cues towards an object of interest. The auditory scene should be inviting and pleasant to the user, who will become familiar with the sound environment and find objects fast. The user should not spend more than 1 minute on a page, except for the first page, where they should spend 2 minutes at maximum.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>5. Satisfaction:</b> Users should feel like their browsing experience has become better and faster. They should feel like they know where everything is on the website.<br>
              This project aims to help visually impaired users with the issue of orientation when navigating websites. By the end, users should be confident of where buttons are. Users should be able to get to the end of the prototype in under 6 minutes.

            <h3>VI. Usability test procedure</h3>
            <p>
              Click the follow link to download our test plan first:
              <br>
              <a href="CP_notebook documents/Usability Test Plan.pdf">Usability Test Plan</a>
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>How many examiners are required?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Because we want to gather different comments and results from different people, <b>2 to 3 examiners</b> are required during our test. There are only two roles in our usability test: one is the <b>user</b> and another one is the <b>examiner (observer)</b>. We need 3 to 5 users (participants), and there should be 2 to 3 examiners (observers) present.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>What equipment will the examiners need?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              For the technology part, our computer prototype is built on a website, so they need access to a <b>computer</b> and the <b>internet</b>. Our system is designed for visually impaired people, so the examiners need something to limit their eyesight like <b>blindfolds</b>. They also need <b>headphones</b> for our audio display. For the documentation part, they need to have the <b>Usability Test Plan, User Manual and Installation Guide, and Usability Goals</b> in hand.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>How should your prototype be handled? (manual/documentation)</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              It should be handled as a <b>website</b> being accessed from a computer.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>How will you instruct your examiners to proceed?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              The <b>user</b> needs to read the user manual and installation guide before they do the test. <b>Examiners</b> need to have it at hand and remind <b>the user</b> what to do next when he/she is lost (but not how to do it). <b>Both examiners and users</b> should have usability goals in mind and read the test plan before the test starts. Before and after the test, they should read about how to report and how to evaluate twice. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>How should the examiners treat the test subjects, what should they tell them?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Examiners and users</b> should treat the test subjects with <b>kindness and patience</b>. They should read the user manual and installation guide carefully before the test and think about their tasks and what we want them to think during the test. <b>Examiners</b> should avoid telling the <b>user</b> how to do the tasks, but <b>remind him/her of what he/she needs to do when he/she is lost</b>.
              <br>
              <br>
             <b>What should the examiners avoid doing?</b> 
              <br>
              <br>
              Examiners should <b>avoid giving the user directions, personal opinions, feedback (verbal), interrupts, or making noises</b>. Examiners and users should <b>avoid conducting the test in a noisy environment</b> because we have an audio display that plays an important role in our system.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>What should the examiners avoid telling the test subjects?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Examiners should <b>avoid giving feedback on how well the user is performing</b>. Also, they need to <b>avoid telling the user how to do a task</b>.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>What/How/When/Where should the examiners measure?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              What & How & When: Examiners should <b>present the user with the prototype and measure the time he/she spends</b> on completing each task. They should also <b>count the number of mistakes or pauses</b> the user makes when completing each task.<br>
              Where: This is very important! Examiners need to <b>find a quiet environment</b> and make sure the user can hear our prototype’s sound clearly with a pair of headphones on.
              <br>

            <h3>VIII. Usability Evaluation</h3>
            <p>Please use the <b><a href="CP_notebook documents/Heuristic Evaluation Sheet.pdf">Heuristic Evaluation Sheet</a></b> for the usability evaluation. Based on Nielsen’s heuristic evaluation, these are the specific topic to be assessed:
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>1. Visibility of system status:</b> The design should always keep users informed about where they are and what is going on through frequent feedback.
              <br>
              <br>
              Does the system provide good aural feedback according to the user's position and actions? Are the sounds comprehensible, distinguishable, and indicative of the user's actions?
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>2. Match between the system and the real world:</b> The design should use words, phrases, sounds, and concepts familiar to the user while following real-world conventions and making information appear in a logical order.
              <br>
              <br>
              Do the sounds properly indicate the position of buttons? Can the users comprehend the button-sound mapping? Are the users able to navigate the website with knowledge familiar to them?
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>3. User control and freedom:</b> Users need to have an "emergency exit" in case they perform an unwanted action. This exit must not involve multiple steps.
              <br>
              <br>
              Does the system allow the user to go back to the previous page? Does the system allow users to consult an instructions page at any point? Does the system have any page where the user could be stuck in without knowing what to do?
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>4. Consistency and standards:</b> Users should not have to know whether different sounds indicate the same thing. The system should have a clear sound-object mapping and follow conventions.
              <br>
              <br>
              Does the user demonstrate trouble distinguishing the different sounds of the system? Is the user able to understand what each sound indicates?
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>5. Error prevention:</b> The best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring,either by eliminating error-prone conditions, or by checking for them and presenting users with confirmation options before they commit to the action.
              <br>
              <br>
              Does the system contain sources for error? Does the user give feedback to indicate actions are about to be taken? Does the system guide the user towards making a correct decision?
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>6. Recognition rather than recall:</b> User's memory load should be minimized by making elements, sounds, and options recognizable. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information should be easily retrievable.
              <br>
              <br>
              Does the system contain familiar and recognizable sounds? Does the user get lost every time they access a new page? Are the users able to recognize where they are at any given time?
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:</b> Allow users to tailor frequent actions, giving the options of shortcuts that may speed up the interaction process. The design should cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.
              <br>
              <br>
              Does the system allow for experienced users to go straight to the objects of interest? Is the sound feedback fast enough for experienced users? Does the sound slow down experienced users?
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:</b> Every unit of information in an interface should not be irrelevant or rarely needed.
              <br>
              <br>
              Is every sound useful? Does the system contain elements that are rarely used, or not used at all?
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>9. Help and documentation:</b> For some complex systems, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.
              <br>
              <br>
              Does the system have sufficient documentation to help users? Is the documentation helpful and easily accessible? Does it contain a tutorial? Does it have a user manual with precise instructions on how to operate the system?
