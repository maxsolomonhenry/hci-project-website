        <p>From the two low fidelity prototypes we explored, we decided to create an audio engine that spatialized based
          on a flat, "forward-to-backward" orientation rather than a newspaper-style, "up-and-down" orientation
          typically associated with websites. From here we gathered additional observations from the low-fidelity
          prototype recordings, classmatesâ€™ suggestions, and our meeting with T.A. Juliette. We decided to focus on the
          following four areas to improve in our computer prototype.
          <br>
          <br>
          1. The first thing that improved was the particular sounds on our engine. One of the participants in our study
          mentioned that the sounds were <i>"annoying,"</i> which could decrease the long-term usability of the product.
          We would like users to feel comfortable staying for a long time on certain webpages, if they so desire. Rather
          than sinusoidal beeps and boops, the new system features pleasant, musical sounds with reverb, that easily
          guide users to find the buttons.
          <br><br>
          2. Next we had to address a fundamental issue with the way users spatialize sound internally. One of the
          participants noted that it took a lot of time for them to understand <i>"why we move the speaker in a reverse
            position of the cursor"</i>. It became clear to us that users have to be made to think of the system not as
          a auralizin a flat webpage, but as creating a 3D environment. When we move our heads to the left, sound moves
          (relatively) to the right. This notion is a part of our everyday experience, and it was important to
          communicate to the user that they need to think of the system on this, somewhat different way. As a result, we
          provide a detailed onboarding tutorial, and emphasize this notion in the user guide with a step-to-step
          instruction and a detailed explanation of the concepts of moving. Please review our <b>User manual and
            installation guide</b> for a detailed explanation.
          <br>
          <br>
          3. It occured to us that the system had little feedback, aside from orientation. Juliette noted that she could
          not figure out if she clicked the button or not with her eyes closed. She suggested that we should <i>have an
            indication of whether the user clicked the button or not</i> to increase <i>usability and user
            experiences</i>. Now there is a sound that indicates that the user has clicked, and a new page has loaded
          (it's a pleasant "ding" sound).
          <br>
          <br>
          4. As mentioned earlier, we opted to use a so-called "straight-forward" rather than an up-and-down newspaper
          model for the audio engine. In our low-fidelity prototype, we tested straight-forward and newspaper-style
          models. Then we got the result that the newspaper could be the best solution. However, when we started the
          computer prototype, we found that it is <i>not feasible</i> to build our website in the newspaper way since it
          will be <i>hard for the user to find whether the sound is lower or upper</i> and is <i>hard to implement</i>.
          So we built our website with <i>the straight-forward model</i>, the sounds are <i>moving in front and behind
            instead of up and down</i>. <i>Now it is feasible</i> to test all functions.

        <h3>IV. User population</h3>
        <p>Our project proposal establishes our target population is those who have been non-sighted from birth;
          specifically, those who (1) have no visual preconceptions about what the internet looks like or what a website
          looks like , and (2) are accustomed to physically navigating their world through aural cues. We suspect this
          population has a superior capacity to build an internal model of an environment based on its reverberant
          characteristics. That said, we acknowledge that it is difficult to find experts from our target population
          that are within this class. If you are not visually impaired, we request that you close your eyes when
          evaluating the system on the demo sight (after the tutorial).

        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>V. Usability goals</h3>
        <p><b>1. Learnability:</b> The user should be able to learn the sound mapping quickly.<br><br>
          We want our users to quickly understand how moving the cursor affects the sounds they hear. Less than 2
          minutes on the first page, the user should have found the button and clicked on it.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Ease of use:</b> The user should be able to identify the position of multiple objects on the screen and
          determine how they are placed in reference to one another.<br><br>
          The system should allow users to feel that the objects have their own space and that the cursor helps them
          move towards the object. The user should not have to be reminded of how to navigate the system more than
          twice. The user should be able to perform every task without accessing the User Manual more than twice.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Efficiency:</b> The system should not be stressful or cause any sort of sound anxiety to the user.
          Instead, it should feel helpful and inviting.<br><br>
          The system should feel inviting, comfortable and help the users orient themselves by sound cues. After three
          minutes of use, the user should not demonstrate any visible signs of frustration, stress, anxiety, or
          confusion. Visible signs to be considered are: facial expressions, physical movements (hands and legs moving
          uncomfortably, tense), comments, or extensive mouse movements.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Effectiveness:</b> The system should permit the user to find objects without thinking too much.<br><br>
          Users should be able to navigate into pages and directly follow the sound cues towards an object of interest.
          The auditory scene should be inviting and pleasant to the user, who will become familiar with the sound
          environment and find objects fast. The user should not spend more than 1 minute on a page, except for the
          first page, where they should spend 2 minutes at maximum.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>5. Satisfaction:</b> Users should feel like their browsing experience has become better and faster. They
          should feel like they know where everything is on the website.<br><br>
          This project aims to help visually impaired users with the issue of orientation when navigating websites. By
          the end, users should be confident of where buttons are. Users should be able to get to the end of the
          prototype in under 6 minutes.

        <p>
          <br>
        <div class="User_center"> Click the follow link to download our test plan:<br><a
            href="CP_notebook documents/Usability Test Plan.pdf">Usability Test Plan</a></div>

        <br>
        <b>How many examiners are required?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Because we want to gather different comments and results from different people, <b>2 to 3 examiners</b> are
        required during our test. There are only two roles in our usability test: one is the <b>user</b> and another one
        is the <b>examiner (observer)</b>. We need 3 to 5 users (participants), and there should be 2 to 3 examiners
        (observers) present.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>What equipment will the examiners need?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        For the technology part, our computer prototype is built on a website, so they need access to a <b>computer</b>
        and the <b>internet</b>. Our system is designed for visually impaired people, so the examiners need something to
        limit their eyesight like <b>blindfolds</b>. They also need <b>headphones</b> for our audio display. For the
        documentation part, they need to have the <b>Usability Test Plan, User Manual and Installation Guide, and
          Usability Goals</b> in hand.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>How should your prototype be handled? (manual/documentation)</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        It should be handled as a <b>website</b> being accessed from a computer.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>How will you instruct your examiners to proceed?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The <b>user</b> needs to read the user manual and installation guide before they do the test. <b>Examiners</b>
        need to have it at hand and remind <b>the user</b> what to do next when he/she is lost (but not how to do it).
        <b>Both examiners and users</b> should have usability goals in mind and read the test plan before the test
        starts. Before and after the test, they should read about how to report and how to evaluate twice.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>How should the examiners treat the test subjects, what should they tell them?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Examiners and users</b> should treat the test subjects with <b>kindness and patience</b>. They should read
        the user manual and installation guide carefully before the test and think about their tasks and what we want
        them to think during the test. <b>Examiners</b> should avoid telling the <b>user</b> how to do the tasks, but
        <b>remind him/her of what he/she needs to do when he/she is lost</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>What should the examiners avoid doing?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Examiners should <b>avoid giving the user directions, personal opinions, feedback (verbal), interrupts, or
          making noises</b>. Examiners and users should <b>avoid conducting the test in a noisy environment</b> because
        we have an audio display that plays an important role in our system.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>What should the examiners avoid telling the test subjects?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Examiners should <b>avoid giving feedback on how well the user is performing</b>. Also, they need to <b>avoid
          telling the user how to do a task</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>What/How/When/Where should the examiners measure?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        What & How & When: Examiners should <b>present the user with the prototype and measure the time he/she
          spends</b> on completing each task. They should also <b>count the number of mistakes or pauses</b> the user
        makes when completing each task.<br>
        Where: This is very important! Examiners need to <b>find a quiet environment</b> and make sure the user can hear
        our prototypeâ€™s sound clearly with a pair of headphones on.

        <h3>VIII. Usability Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Please use the <b><a href="CP_notebook documents/Heuristic Evaluation Sheet.pdf">Heuristic Evaluation
              Sheet</a></b> for the usability evaluation. Based on Nielsenâ€™s heuristic evaluation, these are the
          specific topic to be assessed:
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>1. Visibility of system status:</b> The design should always keep users informed about where they are and
          what is going on through frequent feedback.
          <br>
          <br>
          Does the system provide good aural feedback according to the user's position and actions? Are the sounds
          comprehensible, distinguishable, and indicative of the user's actions?
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Match between the system and the real world:</b> The design should use words, phrases, sounds, and
          concepts familiar to the user while following real-world conventions and making information appear in a
          logical order.
          <br>
          <br>
          Do the sounds properly indicate the position of buttons? Can the users comprehend the button-sound mapping?
          Are the users able to navigate the website with knowledge familiar to them?
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>3. User control and freedom:</b> Users need to have an "emergency exit" in case they perform an unwanted
          action. This exit must not involve multiple steps.
          <br>
          <br>
          Does the system allow the user to go back to the previous page? Does the system allow users to consult an
          instructions page at any point? Does the system have any page where the user could be stuck in without knowing
          what to do?
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Consistency and standards:</b> Users should not have to know whether different sounds indicate the same
          thing. The system should have a clear sound-object mapping and follow conventions.
          <br>
          <br>
          Does the user demonstrate trouble distinguishing the different sounds of the system? Is the user able to
          understand what each sound indicates?
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>5. Error prevention:</b> The best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring,either by eliminating
          error-prone conditions, or by checking for them and presenting users with confirmation options before they
          commit to the action.
          <br>
          <br>
          Does the system contain sources for error? Does the user give feedback to indicate actions are about to be
          taken? Does the system guide the user towards making a correct decision?
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>6. Recognition rather than recall:</b> User's memory load should be minimized by making elements, sounds,
          and options recognizable. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to
          another. Information should be easily retrievable.
          <br>
          <br>
          Does the system contain familiar and recognizable sounds? Does the user get lost every time they access a new
          page? Are the users able to recognize where they are at any given time?
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:</b> Allow users to tailor frequent actions, giving the options of
          shortcuts that may speed up the interaction process. The design should cater to both inexperienced and
          experienced users.
          <br>
          <br>
          Does the system allow for experienced users to go straight to the objects of interest? Is the sound feedback
          fast enough for experienced users? Does the sound slow down experienced users?
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:</b> Every unit of information in an interface should not be irrelevant
          or rarely needed.
          <br>
          <br>
          Is every sound useful? Does the system contain elements that are rarely used, or not used at all?
          <br>

          <b>9. Help and documentation:</b> For some complex systems, it may be necessary to provide documentation to
          help users understand how to complete their tasks.
          <br>
          <br>
          Does the system have sufficient documentation to help users? Is the documentation helpful and easily
          accessible? Does it contain a tutorial? Does it have a user manual with precise instructions on how to operate
          the system?
