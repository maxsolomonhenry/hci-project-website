                <h3>I. Design Evolution</h3>
                <br>
                <p>According to the alpha system feedback from peers, we implement more features and improve existing
                    features shown as below:

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. First off, based on previous feedback from classmates, we decided to make the alpha system
                    website resemble a <b>usual website</b>. Instead of just having 2 buttons, <b>we apply the engine to
                        our class notebook</b>! Now, with 7 elements (the menu on the left-hand side of the page), the
                    website contains a design more familiar to sighted users. To see the results, please navigate to our
                    notebook at: https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~lduan5/hci/notebook/index.html

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. The second that improved was <b>multiple sounds’</b> influence. One of the peers gives us
                    feedback that when the system has multiple sounds, she/he feels that it is hard to identify the
                    differences between two sounds. So now we assign “class” to each button. In this case, we assign a
                    “class” of footstep sounds to all menu navigation buttons. As one user suggested, this engine may
                    not provide precise localization of all of the elements on the page, but rather give a sense of the
                    layout and the centers of various sorts of activity on this page. When you navigate to our notebook
                    website, you will immediately get a sense of a cacophony of action happening on the left-hand side
                    of the page, which should cue the user to navigate in this direction. Besides, many peers were
                    worried about our system’s multiple sounds’ influence and gave us feedback like “what could happen
                    if there are multiple sounds like more than two on your website’s page?”. Now, our beta system
                    answers their questions that we implement three objects on a page and minor the influences between
                    objects.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. Lastly, we demonstrate the idea of a page scraper and how to implement it. In order to accomplish
                    step 1, we built a simple <b>website scraper</b> into the engine that assigns a new sound to a
                    limited set of items and learns their position on the page using their bounding rectangle
                    coordinates, which is part of the DOM. In this way, we demonstrate that it would be fairly
                    straightforward to extend the engine to arbitrary websites. Ideally, the page scraper will detect
                    the main interactable features of a webpage, such as buttons, images, titles, items, and map them to
                    different classes of sounds. For example, all buttons have "ding" sounds, titles have "keyboard
                    typing" sounds, etc. With a mechanism that scrapes the page and plays specific sounds for each type
                    of object present, the user would not only be able to identify the position of objects, but also
                    classify the type of object present on that section of the screen.
