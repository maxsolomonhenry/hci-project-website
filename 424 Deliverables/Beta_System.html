                <h3>I. Design Evolution</h3>
                <br>
                <p>According to the alpha system feedback from peers, we implement more features and improve existing
                    features shown as below:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. First off, based on previous feedback from classmates, we decided to make the alpha system
                    website resemble a usual website. Instead of just having 2 buttons, we included 2 images: One of a
                    forest, one of an ocean. Now, with 4 elements on the screen (2 buttons and 2 images), the website
                    contains a design more familiar to the sighted users. However, the images do not perform actions
                    themselves. They are merely placed to illustrate the possible applications of our system. The
                    Previous Page and Next Page buttons continue to exist and they are still used to navigate from one
                    page to another.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. The second that improved was multiple sounds’ influence. One of the peers gives us feedback that
                    when the system has multiple sounds, she/he feels that it is hard to identify the differences
                    between two sounds. So now we assign “class” to each button. Then each object will have a unique
                    sound that represents it. Besides, many peers were worried about our system’s multiple sounds’
                    influence and gave us feedbacks like “what could happen if there are multiple sounds like more than
                    two on your website’s page?”.Now, our beta system answers their questions that we implement three
                    objects on a page and minor the influences between objects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. The third that improved was the usage of the website. One of the peers commented that he/she
                    wants to see more implementation of our system so he/she suggested that we could implement our
                    website in our group’s notebook. Now, our sound functions are successfully implemented to the
                    website with two sounds one for the previous page and another for the next page which navigates
                    users to go through the pages.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4. Lastly, we demonstrate the idea of a page scraper and how to implement it. However, we did not
                    have time to implement the tool and it cannot be seen on the beta version. The page scraper consists
                    of a tool that detects the main features of a webpage, such as buttons, images, titles, items, and
                    maps them to different classes of sounds. For example, all buttons have "ding" sounds, titles have
                    "keyboard typing" sounds, etc. With a mechanism that scrapes the page and plays specific sounds for
                    each type of object present, the user would not only be able to identify the position of objects,
                    but also classify the type of object present on that section of the screen.

                        For visually-impaired folks, we invite you to continue to use your screen reader to follow
                        through with the
                        onboarding process. You will then be sent through to a demo website with no additional text to
                        allow you to
                        have the full sonic experience of OverHear.

                            substantial hit to performance, but we will keep an eye out and adjust as necessary for the

                            of the system.</p>
