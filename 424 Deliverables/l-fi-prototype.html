        <h3>I. Design concepts</h3>
        <p>In order to center conceptually around the design process, we step through the <i>10 plus 10</i> design
          procedure. This seven-step process begins with a formal statement of the design challenge.</p>
        <h4>The design challenge</h4>
        <p>There are many existing solutions for internet navigation for those who cannot see the screen (either because
          of limited vision, or those who situationally do not have access to a screen); most involve discarding the
          spatial dimension of a website. For example, screen-readers narrate a website content from top to bottom; this
          reduces the 2-dimensional layout of the website into a 1-dimensional stream, which users can only travserse in
          one of two directions. For example, passing from the top to the middle of the page necessitates moving through
          all of the content in between. Eye-tracking data suggest that there are numerous patterns of visual search
          across a website, including an "F-shaped" pattern in which users scan alternately vertically and horizontally
          [1].
          <br><br>
          In this design challenge, we seek to bring the additional degree of freedom of 2-dimensional website
          navigation to those that cannot see a screen. In particular, <i>how can we convey the spatial layout of a
            website using audio?</i>
        </p>

          study of website complexity from cognitive load perspective." <cite>Decision Support Systems</cite> 62: 1-10.

        <h4>The design concept</h4>
        An initial round of sketching leads the team to the following basic design, which forms the basis for ten futher
        variations. A detailed description follows below.
        <br>
        <img class="image_map" src="sketch1.jpeg" alt="Premise of auditory mapping device">
        <br>

        <b>Description.</b> These sketches are meant to be self-explanatory; however, for the curious reader we provide
        detailed information in this paragraph. The user is wearing head phones and has access to a standard mouse or
        trackpad device. In the top figure, the dotted box represents an audio field, i.e., audio that has been mapped
        to the left and right speakers of the heaphones to create some illusion of a three-dimensional space. In the
        second figure, three schematic links, labeled "1" "2" and "3," are shown near a cursor. These links are assigned
        auditory "icons," indicated by the speakers in the third figure. Based on their spatial relationship to the
        cursor, these auditory icons are mapped to different locations in the audio field. As an example, we show a
        hemi-cylindrical field.
        <br><br>
        This design shows considerable promise, but the format permits many possible variations; specifically, there are
        many ways to map the locations of the links to an audio field. We explore these possibilities in the next step
        of the <i>10 plus 10</i> methodology, by sketching ten variations on this theme.
        <br><br>
        <img class="image_map" src="sketch2.jpeg" alt="A second overview">
        <b>Description.</b> A secondary early sketch of links, layouts and auditory icons. We introduce the phrase
        "cocktail party" to refer to the "cocktail party problem," a phenomenon in auditory psychology refering a human
        auditor's natural ability to pick out and focus on one voice from among many intermingled in a crowd. To what
        extent can the team take advantage of this phenomenon, and turn a busy website layout into an auditory cocktail
        party?
        <br><br>
        <img class="image_map" src="sketch3.jpeg" alt="Three initial variations">
        <b>Description.</b> Three initial variations. We determine early on in the sketching process that it is useful
        to give each sketch a nickname, when discussing the relative merits and problems of each. The first sketch is
        "<i>the straight-forward</i>": here, the website is mapped to a flat plane that recedes away from the user.
        Links higher up the page are sonified as farther away. We indicate in the sketch that "distant" is achieved by
        adding extra reverb or echo to the most distant sounds. "<i>The newspaper</i>": this idea is very similar to the
        former; here the website "hovers" in front of the user. Links closest to the cursor are brought closest to
        ear-level. <i>"The bisector"</i> is a variation on the first sketch; here however, the user is immersed in the
        page. Links below the user cursor are mapped to a sound behind the user (it should be noted, however, that this
        is particularly difficult to achieve as a binaural auditory illusion).
        <br><br>
        <img class="image_map" src="sketch4.jpeg" alt="Three more variations.">
        <b>Description.</b> <i>"The hemisphere"</i> makes an exaggerated view of the website by wrapping it around the
        user's head. This takes advantage of the fact that auditors have greater spatial acuity for sounds approaching
        from the side, rather than sounds coming head on. <i>"The vortx"</i> build on the idea of distorted mapping, by
        placing a particularly strong emphasis on the links near the cursor. Here they are brought closer to the user's
        head, while the backgrounded sounds remain distant (with relatively greater reverb/echo). <i>"The buried"</i> is
        an exaggerated combination of the straight-forward and newspaper concepts. Here the plane is tilted backwards,
        to take advantage of both distance- and elevation-related auditory spatial cues; the sketch gets its name from
        the fact that the closest sounds are spectrally altered to sound muffled (perhaps with a simple low-pass
        filter).
        <br><br>
        <img class="image_map" src="sketch5.jpeg" alt="Two more variations">
        <b>Description.</b> With the following sketches we start to move away from the more literal mapping, and start
        to play with intermediate filtering and sorting steps. In <i>"the spotlight"</i>, only those links that are
        close to cursor are sonified. This setup encourages exploration on the part of the user, but will not give a
        full overview of the layout of the page. Perhaps the reduced complexity will make for a more pleasant browsing
        experience. The <i>"rearranger"</i> builds on the idea of focus and simplicity by sorting the page into
        thematically related clusters. Each cluster gets its own auditory icon; and by clicking on this icon, the user
        steps to the next level of detail, e.g., exposing the auditory icons of the constituent links.
        <br><br>
        <img class="image_map" src="sketch6.jpeg" alt="Last two variations">
        <b>Description.</b> Here we continue to play with the idea of segmetation and simplification. In <i>"the
          architect,"</i> rather than intelligently cluster links, the website is subdivided into smaller "rooms". Each
        room is given its own sound-icon based on its location on the main page layout. By clicking to enter a room, the
        user is presented with a smaller, concise sonified layout as in one of the earlier designs. Finally in <i>"the
          heap"</i> we seek to explictly take advantage of the cocktail party effect. Here, all sound icons are played
        at once, at a moderate volume. As the user cursor passes over an object of interest, its auditory icon is made
        louder than the others, but the rest remain in the background. This is an extreme notion, and not one that would
        likely result in user comfort, as it would be very difficult to navigate around the webpage -- there is no
        spatial information whatsoever for the user.

      <div class="container">
        <h3>II. Prototypes</h3>
        <br>
        <p>After we have the sketches, we evaluated all the designs and we picked three of them. The first one we picked
          was the straightforward design because the speakers and the cursor are all moving in a restricted area with
          the same shapes. So the advantage of this design is user-friendly. The second design we picked has a similar
          sound theory to the first design. It is called the newspaper, the user will use it similar to the first one
          but instead of getting sound horizontally, this time the sound is moving vertically. Just like its name, the
          users will be like reading a newspaper when navigating the websites. The last one we picked was the
          semi-cylinder which is one we get after sketching. Compared to the first two designs, semi-cylinder speakers
          will move closer to the user and the sound is moving in a 3D platform. So we would like to prototype this
          design to see whether a more surrounded sound environment will bring a better experience to the user.
          <br>
          <strong><u>Straight-forward:</u></strong>
          The user uses the cursor to find the aimed object at the top of the page. When the cursor moves up the page,
          the speaker will move closer to the user. When the cursor moves down the page, the speaker will move further
          away from the user.</br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="2 pic/Prototype SF1.PNG" alt="SF1" border=0 width=50% height=auto></td>
            <td><img src="2 pic/Prototype SF2.PNG" alt="SF2" border=0 width=50% height=auto></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        Karl has set up the environment for the cursor and the speakers. They all move in a horizontal plane. In the
        first picture, Karl moves the cursor from the middle to the left side of the page. So in the second picture, you
        can see the outcome of the speaker that the speaker moves to the right. The reason why it is moving in an
        opposite way is that the red speaker denotes the aimed red object. At the starting point, the sound of the
        speaker tells you that it is on the left-hand side. So after the movement, you will know that the object is in
        front of you. </br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="2 pic/Prototype SF3.PNG" alt="SF3" border=0 width=50% height=auto></td>
            <td><img src="2 pic/Prototype SF4.PNG" alt="SF4" border=0 width=50% height=auto></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        Then Karl prototypes what will happens if the cursor goes up. So he first set the cursor at the middle and the
        two objects are both on the top corners. Then the speakers need to move closer to the user since the user is in
        the middle. When the cursor moves up in the page then the two speakers move down to the bottom of the page. To
        think Straight forward in an easy way, we can assume the user(reference of the cursor) always stays at the
        bottom middle point.
        <br>
        <strong><u>Newspaper:</u></strong>
        Similar to the straight-forward design, but the plane is vertically and perpendicular to the cursor’s moving
        area. So if our aimed object is at the top of the page then, the speaker will move down when the cursor moves
        up.
        <br>
        Karl has set up the environment this time the speakers move on the wall which is perpendicular to the table. the
        newspaper design shows the same behavior as the straight-forward that when the cursor moves to the left, the
        speaker will move to the right. So here we will see how it behaves with two speakers.</br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="2 pic/Prototype N1.PNG" alt="N1" border=0 width=50% height=auto></td>
            <td><img src="2 pic/Prototype N2.PNG" alt="N2" border=0 width=50% height=auto></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        We then find the difference that in this design, the user(the reference of the cursor) is assumed to be the
        middle point. Like the above picture 1 illustrates when the cursor is at the middle point. Two speakers will be
        exactly upper and downer side of it. In picture 2, the cursor moves down to the green point to the green speaker
        will be at the middle which is what the user is aiming at.</br>
        <img src="2 pic/Prototype N3.PNG" alt="N3" width=30% height=auto>
        <br>
        Here Karl is a little bit unsure about where to place these two speakers. First of all, the cursor is at the
        bottom left corner. Then that’s the user’s view and what the user is aiming at. The next step to do is to value
        the cursor’s position to be the middle point of the speaks’ plane. So we get the answer that the green speaker
        should be exactly on its right while the red one will be upper than the green one.
        <br>
        <strong><u>Semi-cylinder:</u></strong>
        As you can see from the following graphs, the semi-cylinder design is similar to the newspaper design. But
        instead of a perpendicular flat plane, the semi-cylinder design is creating a more surrounded environment such
        that the user can detect the direction of the sound easier.
        <br>
        Karl has set up the environment as you can see the user is facing the speaker moving plane. From graph 1 to
        graph 2 below, Karl moves the cursor to the right such that the two speakers need to move to the middle of the
        whole plane. From this observation, we know that this design assumes the user to be in the center of the plane
        also.
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="2 pic/Prototype SC1.PNG" alt="SC1" border=0 width=50% height=auto></td>
            <td><img src="2 pic/Prototype SC2.PNG" alt="SC2" border=0 width=50% height=auto></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        Here is an interesting case, the following picture shares the same result when the cursor is closer to the two
        objects. Thus the whole plane needs to increase its size to make sure the user can easily track if he/she is
        close or far from the object.</br>
        <img src="2 pic/Prototype SC3.PNG" alt="SC3" width=30% height=auto>
        <br>
        <strong><u>Conclusion:</u></strong>
        Karl has done a lot of test cases to see if our picked design works in reality. Although the semi-cylinder could
        give users a better sound experience. The size of the plane is still a hard thing to think about. Besides, we
        want to use sensors for transitive signals it is hard to install sensors in this case. Overall, we find some
        drawbacks of semi-cylinder, so our test designs are straightforward and newspaper.

        <h3>III. Usability goals and benchmark tasks</h3>
        <h4>Usability Goals:</h4>
        <p>
          1. <u>Learnability:</u> The user should be able to learn the sound mapping quickly.</br>
          We want our users to quickly understand how moving the cursor affects the sounds they hear.</br>
          2. <u>Ease of use:</u> The user should be able to identify the position of multiple objects on the screen, and
          determine how they are placed in reference to one another.</br>
          One of the most popular assistive technologies for visually-impaired internet users is the screen-reader
          system. Screen readers must necessarily collapse the website into a one-dimensional stream of information, and
          do not permit users to understand the relative placement of objects in a webpage. The system should allow
          users to feel that the objects have their own space, and that the cursor helps them move towards the
          object.</br>
          3. <u>Efficiency:</u> The system should not be stressful or cause any sort of sound anxiety to the user.
          Instead, it should feel helpful and inviting.</br>
          The system is intended to be an every-day assistant to the visually impaired. Therefore, it cannot be
          stressful to the ears or to the mind. The system should feel inviting, comfortable, and help the user orient
          themselves by sound cues. After two to three minutes of use, the user should have a reasonable sense of where
          every object is on the page. </br>
          4. <u>Effectiveness:</u> The system should permit the user to find objects with confidence, and without
          spending too much time thinking.</br>
          Users should be able to navigate into a new webpage and directly follow the sound cues towards an object of
          interest. The experience should be faster, less stressful, and require fewer interactions than current
          screen-reader assistants. The auditory scene should be inviting and pleasant to the user, who will in turn
          become familiar with the sound environment associated with a given page, and will be able to come back at any
          time knowing where objects are placed.</br>
          5. <u>Satisfaction:</u> Users should feel like their browsing experience has become better and faster. They
          should feel like they know where everything is on the website.</br>
          The goal of this project is to help visually impaired users with the issue of orientation when navigating
          websites. Therefore, it is essential that users feel the system is not only pleasant to use, but helpful.
          <br>
          <br>
        <h4>Benchmark tests:</h4>
        1. Navigate towards the object that is closest to your cursor, and double click.</br>
        2. Move your cursor at the other object on the page; double click when you have arrived there.</br>
        3. Find the halfway point between these two objects, and double click.</br>
        4. Find the greatest distance from the two objects without reaching the edge of the website, and double
        click.</br>
        5. Make a rough sketch of the layout of the page as you imagined it.

        <b>>Description of video</b>. The participant is completing the first task, "find the closest object to your
        cursor," using the second prototype tests. The second prototype, nicknamed "the straight-forward," situates the
        user in the middle of a flat 2-d plane. Objects below the cursor are mapped to behind the user; objects above
        the cursor are mapped to in front of the user; left and right are mapped as usual.
        <br><br>
        The electrical source is generating two simple sounds, a sine tone of a certain pitch, accompanied by pink
        noise, though a low frequency sawtooth amplitude envelope; each is mapped to one of the left and right speakers.
        Two experimentors "Wizard of Oz" the location of the speakers, by consulting the location of the participant's
        "cursor" (finger) on the "website" (the paper with a simple illustration). The experimentors orient themselves
        roughly by using the grid of tape on the table. In the other tested prototyped, "the newspaper," a similar grid
        marks the wall.

        Each participant was filmed during testing, and was observed remotely by a third experimentor via video-chat.
        <br><br>
        <h4>Task-relevent test results</h4>
        <b>Task 1: Navigate towards the closest object to your cursor</b>. Both subjects reported initially feeling lost
        and having to make rapid decisions about where to navigate. The second participant, after mentioning this
        explicitly out loud, proceeded to adjust their behaviour for the second prototype, and making quick decisions
        was able to readily find the target objects. Participant 1 took an average of 84 seconds to find the first
        object. Participant 2 took an average of 11 seconds.
        <br><br>
        <b>Task 2: Move your cursor to the other object</b>. Performance on this task was largely a function of the
        amount of time spent on the first task. Participants who spent a long time on finding the first object reported
        feeling "lost" after several seconds of searching. User comments from this task include "this is really hard!"
        and "this is difficult." Participants who were decisive and navigated quickly tended to make fewer reversals,
        and find the second object with greater accuracy and in less time.
        <br><br>
        <b>Task 3: Find the halfway point between these two objects</b>. This was a difficult task for participants to
        achieve; neither participant pointed to physically half-way between the two objects at any point; however,
        Participant 2 consistently found a spot that was equidistant from both objects/sound sources, though not
        necessarily half-way between. Participant 1, who was "lost," could not find a satisfactory half-way point.
        <br><br>
        <b>Task 4: Find the greatest distance from these two objects</b>. This task, which was meant to determine
        whether users could find the edge of the page, or of the website, was confounded by poor prototype-and-test
        design. Participants were easily able to feel the edge of the paper page, and commenting "is this the edge?" and
        "am I allowed to go outside of the paper?". Participants were generally more decisive in this task (i.e.,
        double-clicked in less time, and made fewer reversals) when using the <i>straight-forward</i> prototype;
        performance was almost random with the <i>newspaper</i> prototype.
        <br><br>
        <b>Task 5: Make a rough sketch of the layout</b>. This was perhaps the most informative and surprising of all
        tasks. In general, sketches made in the <i>straight-forward</i> prototype were accompanied by more decisive
        comments than with the <i>newspaper</i> prototype. Even when users reported feeling lost, they were able to
        determine the relative distance of the two objects, placing them at far ends of the top-and-bottom of page as
        per our test designs. Interestingly, in three of the four sketches received, <b>the left and right axes were
          consistently flipped</b>. That is to say, the up-and-down structure of the layout was in tact, but objects on
        the left side of the screen were mapped to the right side of the sketch, and visa versa. The exact mechanism of
        this effect is not known; though it is worth considering this effect when moving forward with the design. For
        example, is it important that users map left to true left, so long as they have a sense of the general
        topography of the webpage? And if so, would reversing the left-and-right panning of the prototype ameliorate
        this behaviour?

        <h4>General Observations</h4>
        <b>Sound uniqueness</b>. Multiple participants commented that the sounds were different to tell apart: "there
        are two sounds?", "are they supposed to be different?". In the future we should focus on sounds that are
        pleasant to listen to for a long time, sounds that evolve over time as a conversation or a piece of music would;
        for example, a bird call.
        <br><br>
        <b>Concentration</b>. Multiple participants also commented on having to "think quickly," because "the longer you
        listen, it's easy to get lost." Participant 1 took a long time to hone in on a precise location, and as a result
        ended up wandering across the page several times, eventually landing fairly far from the objective target.
        Participant 2 worked quickly, and achieved great accuracy in cursor placement.
        <br><br>
        <b>Flipped axes</b>. As mentioned above, users consistently flipped the left-right axes of their aural map of
        the website. This phenomenon must be addressed moving forward.
        <br><br>
        <b>Practicality of prototyping with sound</b>. It was rather hard for the experimentors to Wizard of Oz in
        response to the quick cursor gestures of the user. In the future, we should assess the limitations of our
        performance and ensure that participants are aware of these limitations before experimentation (e.g., "Please
        move your cursor slowly.")
